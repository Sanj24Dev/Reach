    DELVE IN THE DARKNESS OF THE ENDLESS MAZE

        Welcome to the Labyrinth… 
    There are a few entry doors(src) which are waiting to be linked with its exit doors(dst). There are two types of linking of doors – imaginary(soft links) and real(hard links).
    You will have to link the doors according to the conditions given below to find the reward. To do so, here are your commands
    
    Command help
    ------------
    •	img src dst – forms soft links between entry and exit doors
    •	real src dst  – forms hard links between the entry and exit doors
    •	remove dst —unlinks the doors
    •	total —gives the number of links 
    •	list —lists the doors linked
    Soft links ---- Doesn’t get added up in total number of links
    Hard links ---- Gets added up in total number of links

    Initial number of links --- 5
    Total number of links at the end --- 8
    Entry doors --- a.txt	b.txt	c.txt	d.txt	e.txt
    Exit doors --- f.txt	g.txt	h.txt	i.txt	j.txt

    Conditions on new links
            Hard Links		Soft Links
    a.txt		1			1
    b.txt		0			2
    c.txt		2			0
    d.txt		0			0
    e.txt		1			0

    The reward is found behind a door. You will know it only after you complete the linking successfully.
    
    Once you get the reward use “push char” command to collect your reward and go to next level.
    Best of Luck!!!
